# Getting Started
You won't need to follow these steps, but I'm showing everything I did to land at a git repository on github, a plugged in BBB, ssh into it, and anything else I haven't thought of.  This is just a placeholder for now.  I want to skip ahead to some development first and come back to it later...and show how smart I am in hindsight.  ;)

# project_blur
## What is this?
This is a journal-like bit of development I'm doing to show off a bit of c++ on the BeagleBone Black (BBB).  It is a basic image processing application which I haven't really planned out, so it may morph into something else.  I'll keep a journal in the journal subdirectory which will have a tutorial-like feel with images and steps and how-tos and how-did-i-get-heres.
## What is required?
- A BeagleBone Black...although this code should be fairly portable.  I hope to make use of the Neon SIMD stuff eventually so that might be where things get weird.
- Some c++ know-how.  I've been writing c++ for quite a while now and while I'm not even close to good at it, I won't explain simpler things.  If I feel a comment is needed I'll provide it and if I feel a reference is needed I'll provide a link.
- Some means to ssh into the BBB or if you prefer, all the cables and equipment needed to do the development directly on the board.  I'm using Git Bash b/c I'm using windows out of laziness.
- GIMP, as I'll be using it as my means of opening .ppm files and probably to generate reference images.
